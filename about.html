        <p id="bio">
          I am 22 years old, born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I have
          one older brother and a younger sister. I went to a private school in
          the city called Dandii Boru and was there my entire young adult school
          life.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2019 after I graudated high school, I came to Albany, NY to attend
          Siena College for my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. Later
          changed to Software Devlopment to make the area of study more
          specific.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am set to finish my program on June 24 but celebrating graudation on
          May with the rest of my class year. I have learned so much through my
          4-year experience in Siena. Time management, Communication, Team
          Collaborating, different software languages and other technical and
          soft skills.

          I use both my phone and digital camera to take my pictures and use
          free apps mostly to edit them. I believe in simplicity instead of
          forcing creativity.
